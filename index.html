                <p><a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/PROG/110" target="_blank">Programming 110: Introduction to programming: 5 credits</a></p>
              <p>Professor: Dennis Minium</p>
              <p>Description *taken from the bellevue college website*:
            Using a current object-oriented programming language, 
            students learn and apply the fundamental principles of programming. Students design solutions, write computer instructions to solve business problems, learn procedural programming, document and debug computer applications.</p>
            <p>Before this class I had no knowledge of how to code. I knew what it was and what it looked like,
              but I couldn't understand any of it. After this class I learned a very good introduction to C# and how to problem slove in programming.</p>

              <p>Before this class I had some programming knowledge. I had completed prog 110 and had an idea what coding was like. However, I had no web design expierence. That's what 
              this class taught me. It taught me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It taught me how to make and code a web page and I had a good time doing it.</p>
